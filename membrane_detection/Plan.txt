Goal: Find endpoints of orphans
Plans of attack:
(1) Mean shift - to find skeletons, extract endpoints from skeleton
        1. Downsample in order to make it computationally possible - currently where we're at
        2. Use masking for each seg id to isolate the part of the slice corresponding to it
        3. Calculate centroids (can use OpenCV) (find a way to force centroid placed to be within the segmentation)
        4. Track centroids through subvolumes to extract skeleton

(2) Principal axis - find vector corresponding to principle axis and run this agains tthe mesh to somehow find endpoints (need to hash this out more - little bit fuzzy)
(3) Alternative smoothing strategy - Apply either Humfrey or Laplacian smoothing prior to decimation and see whether that will help

Other things to do:
(1) Figure out why the decimation isn't working - get all the components > 30 in size and visualize them!
(2) Figure out why we're getting whackass endpoints with the alternative smoothing strategy when we apply it before doing decimation
